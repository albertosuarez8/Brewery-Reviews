# <Venue-Views>

## Description

Between parking lot prices, players taking the night off due to "load management", and high surprise ticket fees the average sports van or concert goer is losing more and more control over their experience while paying a higher price as well. Most of the time these fans are spending upwards of hundreds of dollars for 2-3 hours and don't know anything but their seat number before they show up to the venue. Not to forget that load bearing pillars in your sightline and the aroma of a bathroom just over your shoulder greatly impact your experience and don't show up on an ordinary birds eye view map that most of these ticket sellers give. 

Venue Views was created to help the average fan perfect their stadium experience as much as possible. Our application not only gives you a view of the field/court from your section but also reviews from past visitors on everything from concession prices to bathroom cleanliness. While you may be getting surprise fees from purchasing the ticket, we want to ensure that that is the only surprise you receive before you get to the venue.
