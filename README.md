# Brewery-Reviews

## Description

After getting off work and going out for a drink the last thing you want is a watering hole that is not up to your standards. While apps like Yelp exist and allow users to leave customer reviews they don't have brewery specific information, like the type of brewery it is. Not to forget that many of the reviewers may not be interested in breweries so there isn't a strong community of proud beer aficionados.

Brewery Reviews was created to help brewery enthusiasts perfect their experience as much as possible. For the amount of money you are spending, you want to ensure that you're not only getting a fair value, but also a place where you and your brew buddies make memories that last a lifetime.
Our application gives you reviews from prior patrons on everything including prices, the type of brewery, and even the selection offered. Users can include a picture as well to show others what they have to look forward to. When you go out for a drink you want to enjoy it with those close to you without breaking the bank unexpectedly, and we hope that our community can help ensure it's a night well spent.
